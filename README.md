# App-Code-Design
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The purpose of the weight tracking application will be to help users reach their desired target weight within the desired time frame. The weight tracking application has three screens: Login, view weight, and enter weight. The weight tracking application is for users that like to work towards a goal for their own type of weight management.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- The weight tracking application supports the user needs by having three main screens for the user to see their daily progress. there are three user interface screens. First, the login screen that allows users to login to an existing account or create a new account. Second, the view weight screen displays the users weight entry for every day the user had entered it. Third, the entry weight screen that allows users to use the input box and save button to either enter their new weight entry or edit their old weight entry. The design is simple and easy to navigate around making for a great first impression to the users.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
- The application has an iterative approach to both the design and code. I relied on the information and skills gained from the course material and developer.android.com website to help guide me through the process of designing my weight tracking application. The material and the developer.android.com website explained how to understand and use Android Studio properly.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
- Ensuring the code was functional with no occuring errors is by running and testing the code. This is impportant to avoid any type of security weaknesses to the application. The Android Studio had a debugger feature to help test the code to see if the application was behaving correctly.
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- Designing a mobile app is not an easy task but using the layout editor in Android Studio to help create all the layouts in my application really helped me bring my application to life easier.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- The textbook material and the developer.android.com website were a big help with my success within this course. My understanding of Java programming language and Android Studio has helped build my skill level by creating buttons, database, and objects within the application.
